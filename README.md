### GLOBAL COVID-19 IMPACT AND VACCINATION ANALYSIS

#### **1. Introduction**

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global population, resulting in millions of cases and deaths. As countries and regions have responded differently to the pandemic, the outcomes have varied significantly. This analysis seeks to explore the spread of COVID-19, the effectiveness of mitigation measures, and the progress of vaccination campaigns around the world. By leveraging SQL queries to analyze global COVID-19 data, this project aims to provide insights into infection rates, mortality rates, and the percentage of populations vaccinated, thereby offering valuable information for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

#### **2. Objectives**

The objectives of this project are:

Analyze Infection and Mortality Rates: To evaluate the severity of COVID-19 across different countries and continents by calculating infection rates and death percentages.
Assess Vaccination Progress: To examine the extent to which different populations have been vaccinated and understand how vaccination rates correlate with COVID-19 outcomes.
Identify High-Risk Regions: To identify countries and continents with the highest infection rates, death counts, and lowest vaccination rates.
Provide Actionable Recommendations: To offer recommendations for improving public health responses based on the data insights.

#### **3. Methodology**

**3.1 Data Sources**
Covid_Deaths.CovidDeaths: This table contains data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population metrics across various countries.
Covid_vaccinations.CovidVaccinations: This table includes data on COVID-19 vaccinations across different countries and continents.

**Dataset Description**
The datasets used in this analysis are focused on COVID-19 statistics, including data on reported cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents. These datasets provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact globally and are crucial for understanding the spread and control of the virus.

**1. Covid_Deaths.CovidDeaths**

This dataset contains detailed information about COVID-19 cases and deaths reported globally. The key attributes of this dataset include:

iso_code: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code representing each country.
continent: The continent to which the country belongs.
location: The name of the country or region.
date: The date of the reported data.
total_cases: The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases up to that date.
new_cases: The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on that date.
total_deaths: The cumulative number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 up to that date.
new_deaths: The number of new deaths reported on that date.
population: The total population of the country or region.
population_density: The population density of the country or region (people per square kilometer).
median_age: The median age of the population.
aged_65_older: The percentage of the population aged 65 and older.
gdp_per_capita: The gross domestic product per capita.
life_expectancy: The average life expectancy in years.
hospital_beds_per_thousand: The number of hospital beds per 1,000 people.
human_development_index: The Human Development Index value, which measures a country's average achievements in health, knowledge, and standard of living.

**2. Covid_vaccinations.CovidVaccinations**

This dataset provides data on the vaccination efforts against COVID-19 across the world. The key attributes of this dataset include:

iso_code: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code representing each country.
continent: The continent to which the country belongs.
location: The name of the country or region.
date: The date of the reported data.
total_vaccinations: The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered.
people_vaccinated: The cumulative number of people who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
people_fully_vaccinated: The cumulative number of people who have been fully vaccinated (received all required doses).
new_vaccinations: The number of new vaccine doses administered on that date.
total_vaccinations_per_hundred: The total number of vaccinations per 100 people in the total population.
people_vaccinated_per_hundred: The number of people vaccinated per 100 people in the total population.
people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred: The number of people fully vaccinated per 100 people in the total population.
population: The total population of the country or region.
stringency_index: A composite measure based on nine response indicators including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest).

**Data Sources and Credibility**
Both datasets are derived from global databases that aggregate and harmonize COVID-19 data from official government sources, international health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), and other reputable institutions. The data is updated regularly to ensure it reflects the most current information available.

**Purpose of the Datasets**
The datasets serve as a critical resource for analyzing the impact of COVID-19, tracking the progression of the pandemic, and evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions, including vaccination campaigns. By analyzing these datasets, we can gain insights into the virus's spread, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the relationship between various demographic factors and COVID-19 outcomes.

**3.2 Analysis Steps**

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Replace NULL values with zeros using COALESCE to ensure accurate calculations.
Handle potential division by zero cases in rate calculations.
Calculation of Infection and Mortality Rates:

Determine the percentage of populations infected by COVID-19.
Calculate the death percentage among confirmed COVID-19 cases for each country.
Vaccination Progress Analysis:

Calculate the cumulative number of people vaccinated in each country.
Determine the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
Identifying High-Risk Regions:

Identify countries with the highest infection rates and death counts.
Examine continental trends in death counts and vaccination progress.
